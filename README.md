# Project excercise for Electromagnetic Fields course - BME 2024/2025/1 semester

Electromagnetic simulation for finding a hole in the wall of a steel tube.\
Using the PDE Toolbox the resistance of tube is measured by simulating the stationary currents flowing through it.\
By formulating an inverse optimization problem the location of the ring shaped hole can be estimated from the measured resistance.

The folder called HoleDisp contains the scripts for simulations, where the hole is moved accross the cross section of the tube.\
The folder called SensDisp contains the scripts for simulations, where the Ohm meter is moved on the surface of the tube.
